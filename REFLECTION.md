##Encountered Designs
When considering a design for my dashboard I took into consideration many designs that I had encountered for example at Mcdonalds you have the dashboard which receives live notifications for when a persons food is ready, another design I considered was the dashboard at the airport that receives live updates of plane arrivals and departures. I also considered the dashboard in Anglesea Building that shows upcoming deadlines, I developed my coursework around this design.

##Technologies
Technologies I encountered during the completion of this coursework included node.js which allowed me to write JavaScript code that was executed outside of the browser, allowing me to create a server which allowed for information from the browser to be sent to the server which was then saved to a JSON file. I also used the file system module to write the deadlines to a JSON file.

##Things Learnt
Doing this coursework helped me to understand the processes behind developing a web application. This also allowed me to develop my confidence in doing client-side and server-side programming. I also learnt how to use JSON file to store data effectively. Developing this application and the lectures for this module helped to learn and understand industry practices for web application designing. However during the completion I did encounter some problems for example I was trying to figure out a way to store the deadlines and then I came across the file system module which allowed me to write to a json file.
